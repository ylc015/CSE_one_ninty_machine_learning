# CSE_one_ninty_machine_learning

text_mining file contains a linear regression model that predicts the points that a particular wine will receive.

The input text contains reviews for wines. Each review contains information such as userid of the reviewer, the category that the wine belongs to, and the review in text format.

my approach is using features like the weight of each words in the review text, excluding the usual words like "the" and "of". Incorporating with the category that the wine belongs to and the year that the wine was made.

The model in text_mining file computes the thetas and residuals of the model, as well as the MSE of the model.
